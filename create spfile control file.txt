5. Set up the Oracle database:
a. Ensure that you set the ORACLE_HOME to the same location as it was set to previously.
b. Create the Oracle database with the same SID name that was used previously.
Ensure that the ORACLE_SID, oradata, and flash_recovery_area pathnames are
exactly the same as in the previous configuration.
6. Start the database in the nomount mode by typing the following command:
startup nomount
7. Restore the server parameter file (spfile) by using the following RMAN script:
connect target "/";
set dbid=DBID;
run{
restore spfile to '/HOME/ORACLE/spfiletestdb.ora' from autobackup
MAXSEQ=SEQ
until time = "TO_DATE('DATE','YYYYMMDD')";
}
