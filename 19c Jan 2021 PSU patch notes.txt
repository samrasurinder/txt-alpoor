1.2.1.5 Run OPatch SystemSpace Check
Check if enough free space is available on the ORACLE_HOME filesystem for the patches to be applied as given below:

For Grid Infrastructure Home, as home user:

Create file /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt with the following content:

% cat /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt

<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32218454
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32222571
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32218663
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/29340594
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32240590
Run the opatch command to check if enough free space is available in the Grid Infrastructure Home:

% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckSystemSpace -phBaseFile /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt
For Database home, as home user:

Create file /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt with the following content:

% cat /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32218454
<UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239/32222571
Run opatch command to check if enough free space is available in the Database Home:

% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckSystemSpace -phBaseFile /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt



#GRID_HOME/OPatch/opatchauto apply <UNZIPPED_PATCH_LOCATION>/32226239 -analyze



Any databases that have invalid objects after the execution of datapatch should have utlrp.sql run to revalidate those objects.

For example:
cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
sqlplus /nolog
SQL> CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
SQL> @utlrp.sql
