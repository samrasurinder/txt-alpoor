1- SQL Profile Finding (see explain plans section below)
--------------------------------------------------------
  A potentially better execution plan was found for this statement.

  Recommendation (estimated benefit: 99.31%)
  ------------------------------------------
  - Consider accepting the recommended SQL profile to use parallel execution
    for this statement.
    execute dbms_sqltune.accept_sql_profile(task_name => 'staName36333',
            task_owner => 'SYSTEM', replace => TRUE, profile_type =>
            DBMS_SQLTUNE.PX_PROFILE);

  Executing this query parallel with DOP 160 will improve its response time
  99.31% over the original plan. However, there is some cost in enabling
  parallel execution. It will increase the statement's resource consumption by
  an estimated 10.03% which may result in a reduction of system throughput.
  Also, because these resources are consumed over a much smaller duration, the
  response time of concurrent statements might be negatively impacted if
  sufficient hardware capacity is not available.

  The following data shows some sampled statistics for this SQL from the past
  week and projected weekly values when parallel execution is enabled.

                                 Past week sampled statistics for this SQL
                                 -----------------------------------------
  Number of executions                                                   0 
  Percent of total activity                                              0 
  Percent of samples with #Active Sessions > 2*CPU                       0 
  Weekly DB time (in sec)                                                0 

                              Projected statistics with Parallel Execution
                              --------------------------------------------
  Weekly DB time (in sec)                                                0 

2- Index Finding (see explain plans section below)
--------------------------------------------------
  The execution plan of this statement can be improved by creating one or more
  indices.

  Recommendation (estimated benefit: 93.74%)
  ------------------------------------------
  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index EAPS.IDX$$_3CE1E0001 on EAPS.AMERICAN_EMPLOYEE("ETL_MMYYYY","A
    MER_EMP_POS_STATUS_IND");

  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index EAPS.IDX$$_3CE1E0002 on EAPS.LOCAL_EMPLOYEE("ETL_MMYYYY","FN_E
    MP_POS_STATUS_IND");

  Rationale
  ---------
    Creating the recommended indices significantly improves the execution plan
    of this statement. However, it might be preferable to run "Access Advisor"
    using a representative SQL workload as opposed to a single statement. This
    will allow to get comprehensive index recommendations which takes into
    account index maintenance overhead and additional space consumption.
