2.1.1.5 Run OPatch System Space Check
Check if enough free space is available on the ORACLE_HOME filesystem for the patches to be applied as given below:

For Grid Infrastructure home, as home user:

Create file /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt with the following content:

% cat /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt

/infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768/33192793
/infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768/33208123

/infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768/32585572




Run the OPatch command to check if enough free space is available in the Grid Infrastructure home:

% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckSystemSpace -phBaseFile /tmp/patch_list_gihome.txt
For Oracle home, as home user:

Create file /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt with the following content:

% cat /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt
/infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768/33192793
/infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768/33208123
Run OPatch command to check if enough free space is available in the Oracle home:

% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckSystemSpace -phBaseFile /tmp/patch_list_dbhome.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands check for conflicts in both the 19c Grid home and the 19c DB homes.

#GRID_HOME/OPatch/opatchauto apply /infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768 -analyze



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apply Patch:
-----------


Case 1: Oracle RAC, where the Grid home and the Oracle homes are not shared and Oracle ACFS file system is not configured
As root user, execute the following command on each node of the cluster:

# <GI_HOME>/OPatch/opatchauto apply /infshare/oracle/patches/OCTPSU/33182768
