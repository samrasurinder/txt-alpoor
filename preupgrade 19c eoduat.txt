  Oracle Component                       Upgrade Action    Current Status
  ----------------                       --------------    --------------
  Oracle Server                          [to be upgraded]  VALID

==============
BEFORE UPGRADE
==============

  REQUIRED ACTIONS
  ================
  1.  Set the value of JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES to a non-zero value, or remove the
      setting entirely and accept the Oracle default.

      The database has JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES=0.

      Starting with Oracle Database 11.2, setting JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES=0 will
      disable job execution via DBMS_JOBS and DBMS_SCHEDULER.

  2.  (AUTOFIXUP) Empty the RECYCLEBIN immediately before database upgrade.

      The database contains 3 objects in the recycle bin.

      The recycle bin must be completely empty before database upgrade.

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
  ===================
  3.  Remove initialization parameters that Oracle has obsoleted or removed.
      This action may be done now or when starting the database in upgrade mode
      using the target ORACLE HOME.

      Parameter
      ---------
      O7_DICTIONARY_ACCESSIBILITY

      If parameters that are obsolete or removed from the target release are
      present in the pfile/spfile, the Oracle database may not start, or it may
      start with an ORA- error.

  4.  Run 11.2.0.4.0 $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql to recompile invalid
      objects.  You can view the individual invalid objects with

        SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
        EXECUTE DBMS_PREUP.INVALID_OBJECTS;

      129 objects are INVALID.

      There should be no INVALID objects in SYS/SYSTEM or user schemas before
      database upgrade.

  5.  Explicitly set RESOURCE_LIMIT to FALSE in the pfile/spfile to retain the
      previous behavior.

      the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter is not explicitly set in the
      pfile/spfile.

      The RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter default value changed from
      FALSE to TRUE in 12.1.0.2 onwards.  Without an explicit setting, the
      upgrade may introduce unintented RESOURCE_LIMIT enforcement.

  6.  If an auto-login Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) Keystore is
      correctly set up, no action needs to be taken. Otherwise, before starting
      up the database in upgrade mode in the new Oracle Database Oracle Home,
      either open the TDE Keystore, or ensure that an auto-login TDE Keystore
      is configured for the system.  If errors are seen while the database
      upgrade is running because the TDE Keystore is closed, then open the TDE
      Keystore and resume the upgrade (see "catctl.pl -R").  It may be
      necessary to open the TDE Keystore as the upgrade progresses in a non-CDB
      or CDB (e.g., in CDB$ROOT and PDB) if no auto-login TDE Keystore has been
      configured, as the upgrade process can shutdown and startup the
      database.

      The database is using TDE.  The database upgrade process can involve
      operations (certain SQL statements and/or database startups) that need to
      access the encryption key.

      If Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is in use, the database
      system must have access to its Oracle Transparent Data Encryption Master
      Encryption Key during database upgrade.  For more information on
      configuring Transparent Data Encryption, refer to the 11.2 Oracle
      Database Advanced Security Administrator's Guide, Section 8: Securing
      Stored Data Using Transparent Data Encryption.

  7.  Review and remove any unnecessary HIDDEN/UNDERSCORE parameters.

      The database contains the following initialization parameters whose name
      begins with an underscore:

      _unnest_subquery
      _gby_hash_aggregation_enabled

      Remove hidden parameters before database upgrade unless your application
      vendors and/or Oracle Support state differently.  Changes will need to be
      made in the pfile/spfile.

  8.  (AUTOFIXUP) Gather stale data dictionary statistics prior to database
      upgrade in off-peak time using:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;

      Dictionary statistics do not exist or are stale (not up-to-date).

      Dictionary statistics help the Oracle optimizer find efficient SQL
      execution plans and are essential for proper upgrade timing. Oracle
      recommends gathering dictionary statistics in the last 24 hours before
      database upgrade.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 11.2.0.4
      Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide.

  9.  (AUTOFIXUP) Gather statistics on fixed objects prior the upgrade.

      None of the fixed object tables have had stats collected.

      Gathering statistics on fixed objects, if none have been gathered yet, is
      recommended prior to upgrading.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 11.2.0.4
      Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide.

  INFORMATION ONLY
  ================
  10. To help you keep track of your tablespace allocations, the following
      AUTOEXTEND tablespaces are expected to successfully EXTEND during the
      upgrade process.

                                                 Min Size
      Tablespace                        Size     For Upgrade
      ----------                     ----------  -----------
      SYSTEM                            1000 MB      1092 MB

      Minimum tablespace sizes for upgrade are estimates.

  11. Check the Oracle Backup and Recovery User's Guide for information on how
      to manage an RMAN recovery catalog schema.

      If you are using a version of the recovery catalog schema that is older
      than that required by the RMAN client version, then you must upgrade the
      catalog schema.

      It is good practice to have the catalog schema the same or higher version
      than the RMAN client version you are using.

  ORACLE GENERATED FIXUP SCRIPT
  =============================
  All of the issues in database EODUAT
  which are identified above as BEFORE UPGRADE "(AUTOFIXUP)" can be resolved by
  executing the following

    SQL>@/home/oracle/alpoor_scripts/preupgrade_fixups.sql

=============
AFTER UPGRADE
=============

  REQUIRED ACTIONS
  ================
  None

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
  ===================
  12. Upgrade the database time zone file using the DBMS_DST package.

      The database is using time zone file version 14 and the target 19 release
      ships with time zone file version 32.

      Oracle recommends upgrading to the desired (latest) version of the time
      zone file.  For more information, refer to "Upgrading the Time Zone File
      and Timestamp with Time Zone Data" in the 19 Oracle Database
      Globalization Support Guide.

  13. To identify directory objects with symbolic links in the path name, run
      $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utldirsymlink.sql AS SYSDBA after upgrade.
      Recreate any directory objects listed, using path names that contain no
      symbolic links.

      Some directory object path names may currently contain symbolic links.

      Starting in Release 18c, symbolic links are not allowed in directory
      object path names used with BFILE data types, the UTL_FILE package, or
      external tables.

  14. (AUTOFIXUP) Gather dictionary statistics after the upgrade using the
      command:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;

      Oracle recommends gathering dictionary statistics after upgrade.

      Dictionary statistics provide essential information to the Oracle
      optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans. After a database
      upgrade, statistics need to be re-gathered as there can now be tables
      that have significantly changed during the upgrade or new tables that do
      not have statistics gathered yet.

  15. Gather statistics on fixed objects after the upgrade and when there is a
      representative workload on the system using the command:

        EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_FIXED_OBJECTS_STATS;

      This recommendation is given for all preupgrade runs.

      Fixed object statistics provide essential information to the Oracle
      optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans.  Those
      statistics are specific to the Oracle Database release that generates
      them, and can be stale upon database upgrade.

      For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 11.2.0.4
      Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide.
