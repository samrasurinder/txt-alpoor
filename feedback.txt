


1) Standard Spool file name:
For ex:  <ESSR#>_<ENV>_<SYSDATE>.log
This spool file name can be generated dynamically everytime script runs

2) Include Pre and Post checks for every deployment rather than doing checks outside of scripts deployment:
These checks should be part of every MSR deployment and part of the script itself and then spooled into the same spool log file 

Pre-checks:
-----------
Select * from global_name;
select sysdate from dual;
show user;
select owner,object_name,object_type from dba_invalid_objects


Post-checks/tasks:
-----------------
run utlrp script
select owner,object_name,object_type from dba_invalid_objects



3) Maintain history of each MSR deployment in a standard table on all databases or in a single table in some cerntal repo database:

This would be a simple standard insert statement at the end of every script

Table Structure would be something as follows:


MSR#
date
Script_Name
Env
Deployed (Success/Failed)

This way, it's easy to troubleshoot any deployment issues rather than skimming thru MKS



4) Package all scripts in one main script and call them individually rather than executing one by one


5) Don't spit out errors like table/view don't exist during creation/dropping of any objects.

   Check the exsistense of objects before creation/dropping.
   These kind of errors sometimes misleading
