What is the reasons and possible solutions for issue mentioned in subject ?

Reasons:

indexes was created as NOPARALLEL at source database, so during import they will be creating with NOPARALLEL
IMPDP wasn’t developed to create several indexes in parallel
IMPDP BUGs, like this one – 8604502
Possible Solutions:

modify indexes’ PARALLEL clause at source system before export
ALTER INDEX xxx PARALLEL desired_parallel_level_for_import;
EXPDP …
ALTER INDEX xxx PARALLEL old_parallel_level;
IMPDP …
create indexes separately after modifying DDL (check good post about procedure)
EXPDP …
IMPDP EXCLUDE=INDEX,CONSTRAINT,REF_CONSTRAINT
IMPDP SQLFILE=index_ddls.sql INCLUDE=INDEX,CONSTRAINT,REF_CONSTRAINT
modify index_ddls.sql to correct PARALLEL clause
execute index_ddls.sql to build indexes(may be split in parts and run simultaneously)
after patching IMPDB is able to create indexes concurrently (read more on this)
install PATCH:22273229 at the target system (you don’t require to shutdown instance during installation)
IMPDP PARALLEL=XXX   will create XXX indexes simultaneously
Warning:

if you are prohibited to touch source system – method 1 is not for you.
don’t combine several methods to not overload the target system
for any method used, temporary increase PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET to the largest possible value
