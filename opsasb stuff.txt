Index Finding (see explain plans section below)
--------------------------------------------------
  The execution plan of this statement can be improved by creating one or more
  indices.

  Recommendation (estimated benefit: 67.39%)
  ------------------------------------------
  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index SYSADM.IDX$$_2A67E0004 on
    SYSADM.PS_DEPT_TBL("EFF_STATUS","SETID","DEPTID","EFFDT");

  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index SYSADM.IDX$$_2A67E0006 on
    SYSADM.PS_OP_POSITION_DAT("AGENCY","POSITION_NBR","EFFDT");

  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index SYSADM.IDX$$_2A67E0007 on
    SYSADM.PS_NAMES("NAME_TYPE","EMPLID");

  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index SYSADM.IDX$$_2A67E000B on SYSADM.PS_OP_TM_STG("EMPLID","OP_TM_PROCESSED","OP_TM_ASGN_ID","DEPTID","DEPTID2");

  - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
    or creating the recommended index.
    create index SYSADM.IDX$$_2A67E000F on SYSADM.PS_SJT_CLASS("SCRTY_KEY2","SCRTY_KEY1");


execute dbms_sqltune.accept_sql_profile(task_name => 'staName41619',task_owner => 'ALPOOR', replace => TRUE);

  Rationale
  ---------
    Creating the recommended indices significantly improves the execution plan
    of this statement. However, it might be preferable to run "Access Advisor"
    using a representative SQL workload as opposed to a single statement. This
    will allow to get comprehensive index recommendations which takes into
    account index maintenance overhead and additional space consumption.
